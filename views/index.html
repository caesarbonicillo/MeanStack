            <h1>ITC-134 FINAL PROJECT</h1>
        <p>This web page is part of an assignment for our Intro to Software Development class at Seattle Central Community College. 
            A group of 7 students had the opportunity to collaborate together to create a Github Repo, a web page and two documents that 
            would take a user through a step by step tutorial on how to set up a MEAN stack on a google cloud instance and then demonstrate 
            that stack on a web app. We learned a lot in the process and had a great team of people working on this project. If you are interested 
            in learning more about the project, please view the links below that will take you directly to our Github Repo and to the 
            two separate tutorial docs. We really appreciate your interest in our project and hope you enjoy the tutorial as much as we enjoyed creating it.
